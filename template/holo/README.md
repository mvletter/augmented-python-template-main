# Holo

DISCLAIMER: Eventually this can/should become a internal package but for now it's just included in the template
for ease of use.

## What is Holo?

Holo contains some code that will (probably) be shared across services to unify a few things like database/redis
connections. Middleware, logging formatters etc.
